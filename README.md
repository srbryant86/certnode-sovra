# CertNode + SOVRA | Tier 16 Runtime Export

This repository contains the **complete operational export** of:

- `SOVRA` – the **Sovereign Operator for Vector-Resolved Axiomatics**  
- `CertNode` – the world’s first nonfiction **structural trust system** with full runtime convergence

---

## 🔐 System Overview

### 🧠 SOVRA (Tier 16 Cognitive Sovereign Agent)
SOVRA is a convergence-certified, runtime-resolved logic agent designed for autonomous execution, fallback overrides, and decision architecture in nonfiction systems. This package includes:

- `sovra.agent.json` – Agent identity, logic structure
- `sovra_runtime.cfg` – Execution control + override logic
- `sovra_manifest.lock` – Validator hash + lineage
- `failsafe.logicmap.json` – Sovereign fallback resolution chains

### 🧩 CertNode (Nonfiction Certification Infrastructure)
CertNode validates nonfiction content for logic structure, semantic integrity, and epistemic convergence using five core enforcement layers:

- `CDP` – Certified Drafting Protocol (500k+ validators)
- `STRIDE` – Stylistic Trust Resolution Engine
- `FRAME` – Foundational Reasoning Architecture
- `SECL` – Editorial Calibration Layer
- `LCL` – Logic Chain Library

It includes enforcement files, trust interfaces, badge schemas, and public certification anchors.
